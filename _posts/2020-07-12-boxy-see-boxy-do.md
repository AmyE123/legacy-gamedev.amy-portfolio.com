            <h4>The Athlete</h4>
            <p>Spent so long training his body, but not enough time training his mind. Very easily distracted, if he can see a button, he will press it.</p>
            <h4>The Herb Enthusiast</h4>
            <p>He’ll tell you that his interests are strictly medicinal, but he’s not particularly convincing. Has an antisocial habit of filling the air with smoke so thick you can’t see anything.</p>
            <h4>The Vegan</h4>
            <p>Will eat pretty much any kind of plant, but refuses to hurt animals. Unfortunately, this does not stop the animals from hurting her.</p>
            <h4>The Psychopath</h4>
            <p>Sometimes what you need to solve your problems is a blunt object. And sometimes you need a gun and an empathy disorder. Polly won’t be much use in doing what you ask, unless what you’re asking is killing.</p>

<!--- Main description of the game -->
<!--- ---------------------------- -->
<p>The aim of each level is to interact with the large purple capsule. Each character has their own personality, and while you can ask them to do something, they may refuse, or get distracted and do something else entirely. Once you hit go, it’s up to the characters to decide, it’s out of your hands. You should think about their personalities before asking them to do things, and perhaps their interests will align with yours.</p>
