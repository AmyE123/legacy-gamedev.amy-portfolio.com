<img class="image-heading" src="/assets/img/posts/SidefestMentoring/intro.jpg">
<p>I’ve always been interested to help out students with learning more about games development.<br />I had never done any games mentoring beforehand, and the mentoring knowledge I had, in general, was <em>very small</em> as I’m still a student at the moment. <br />I usually find that the best way to learn is to just <strong>do</strong> whatever it is you want to learn and <em>dive into the deep end</em>.<br />As I wanted to learn about mentoring, as soon as I heard about this opportunity online, I decided to apply straight away!</p>
<p>What I was doing was helping a class of college students out with their own Gamejams, where they used <strong>Twine</strong> to make a game based around student loans.<br />My job was to help the students <strong>find resources</strong>, <strong>manage their workload</strong>, <strong>give feedback,</strong> and <strong>help solve any problems they had with programming</strong>!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">Twine</h3>
<p>The first thing I learned about is <strong>Twine</strong>. <br />Twine is a free and open-source tool for making interactive fiction in the form of web pages.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve never used Twine before</strong>, but as I had to help students out with issues they had, I had to make sure I knew Twine well enough to help out and be able to find good resources.</p>
<p>I spent some time looking over Twine videos and playing around to get to understand it, and then looked into the documentation. It was well documented, so that was a good resource for me to use.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time between me applying to do this, and the gamejam starting, so I was <strong>learning along the way from helping out the students!</strong> And I learnt a lot!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">How to prepare a PowerPoint for teaching</h3>
<p>As well as helping out with problems the students had with Twine, I was tasked to make a PowerPoint to <strong>guide</strong> the students through <strong>how to upload their game to Itch.io</strong>.</p>
<p>This was the PowerPoint I made:</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to be the one presenting the PowerPoint, so I had to make sure it was made with <strong>enough information</strong> for someone to present it.</p>
<p>My aim for this PowerPoint was to make it <strong>bright</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> with colours and pictures, but also have enough information on it for them to learn, but I didn’t want <em>*too*</em> much information that there was just lots of reading to do!</p>
<p>When I was making this PowerPoint, I tried to imagine that I was someone who didn’t know anything about Itch.io, so I included a summary of what Itch.io was, along with some important information about it, how to make an account, and finally how to publish their game, as this is what I would imagine would be important to know!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">How to help</h3>
<p>As this gamejam all ran online on a Discord server, the help I was offering was all text-based, and this would either be by <strong>chatting</strong> to the students or giving them all their feedback on a <strong>board</strong> for them to read through.<br />Here's an example of one of the boards:</p>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/SidefestMentoring/3.jpg" style="width: 100%">
<p>The students would send me their games, and I would play them and give them feedback, as well as this, they would send me their code, and I would give general code feedback, and help them understand good code practices, along with this, I provided multiple resources for the students to refer to, so instead of just telling them the good code practices, I was able to provide examples.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed doing this! And by the end of the week, there were some really clever, and creative games which were produced!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Through helping out with this Gamejam, it’s helped me realize that mentoring is <strong>really fun</strong>! <br />It’s definitely something which I would like to do <strong>more</strong> of in the future.</p>
<p>And as I’ve written this blog a few months after I had done this, I’ve taken part in a few more mentoring activities, which I’ve written about in these blogs below:</p>
