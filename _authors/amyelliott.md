bio: "Hi! My name is Amy, and Im a programmer based in the UK! I love playing and making video games and recently entering the games industry has only increased my interest in games development. Im a big fan of technical and creative experimentation, and I do this by participating in gamejams and small projects  in my spare time. With these small projects and gamejams, I try out as many different things as I can, including developing games from genres Ive not made games for before, and pushing my creativity (both technical and artistic) as far as possible. I love learning new things, from game engines and programming all the way to maths and fun projects using an Arduino. A goal of mine is to try and get more younger and diverse people interested in games development, and to achieve this, Ive mentored students to help them develop games, been into high schools to talk to students about the games industry, and Ive also appeared as a panellist in a few livestreams, like the Women in Games Expo. Another goal of mine is to try and bring more accessibility to video games, to support people with different disabilities as I believe there is currently a lack of accessible video games and accessories."
